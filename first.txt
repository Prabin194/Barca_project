PREFACE

This project has specially been prepared for the partial fulfillment of practical
examination jointly held by Higher Secondary Education Board (HSEB), Nepal &amp;
Department of Computer Science (Sainik Awasiya Mahavidhyalaya) for HSEB
Board Examination 2075 BS (2018 AD). This computer project is a result of my
experience, knowledge, dedication, consultation with computer science experts and
teachers, and references to quality books and websites.

Learning Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Extensible Hypertext Markup
Language (XHTML) is like learning any new language, computer or human. Most
students first immerse themselves in examples. Studying others is a natural way to
learn, making learning easy and fun. Our advice to anyone wanting to learn HTML
and XHTML is to get out there on the World Wide Web with a suitable browser
and see for yourself what looks good, what&#39;s effective, what works for you.
Examine others&#39; documents and ponder the possibilities. Mimicry is how many of
the current webmasters have learned the language.
Imitation can take you only so far, though. Examples can be both good and bad.
Learning by example will help you talk the talk, but not walk the walk. To become
truly conversant, you must learn how to use the language appropriately in many
different situations. You could learn all that by example, if you live long enough.

“The theory without practical is lame and practical without theory is blind.” So, I
have prepared this project in simple way including all the necessary features
accomplished by me to show my prosperity on basic knowledge of Computer
Science. This project includes topics related to Webpage Designing. As there is a
quite popular saying, “a picture speaks more than a word”, I have tried my best to
express theories using images and screenshots

Acknowledge

The success and final outcomes of this project required a lot of guidance and
assistance from many people and I am extremely privileged to have got this all
along the completion of my project. All that I have done is only due to such
supervision and assistance and I would not forget to thank them.
 
I respect and thank Mr. SATYA RAM SUWAL, for providing me an opportunity
to do the project work in SAMB and giving us all supports and guidance which
made me complete the project duly. I am extremely thankful to him for providing
such a nice support and guidance, although he had busy schedule managing the
corporate affairs.
 
I owe my deep gratitude to our project guide MR. NABIN MASKEY, who took
keen interest on our project work and guided us all along, till the completion of our
project work by providing all the necessary information for developing a good
system.
 
I am thankful to and fortunate enough to get constant encouragement, support and
guidance from all Teaching staffs of Department OF Computer Science which
helped us in successfully completing our project work. Also, I would like to extend
our sincere esteems to all staff in laboratory for their timely support.

Objective

The primary goal of the practical in Computer Science is to provide students
the foundations for future work and careers in computation-based problem solving.


A computer science education should provide students the tool and knowledge to
solve problems, this is first and foremost.

Yes, a college education is meant to do just that but anytime a student declares a
major, this student will be going down a path that will be most constructive for
their chosen industry

Computer science is a very broad field. It is considered a subset of mathematics
and like mathematics, it is broad enough that a computer science PhD could talk
about something in one topic that another computer science PhD would be lost in.

The goals of the computer and information sciences department are to prepare
students for graduate training in some specialized area of computer science, to
prepare students for jobs in industry, business or government, and to provide
support courses for students in engineering, mathematics and other fields requiring
computing skills.

Our courses offer a broad base so that students who end their studies with the plus
2 degree can continue to acquire new skills and advance in an always-evolving
professional workplace. We accomplish these goals by placing our computer
science program in the context of the curriculum requirements of the NEB.

INTRODUCTION

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is text markup language used to create
HTML documents (Web Pages) for The Internet. HTML is a set of logical codes or
tags (markup) that are used to define the Web browser how to present the
information in the Web page.
It can be applied and embedded in the text to add formatting, linking that constitute
the appearance of the Web documents and the information. It is interpreted by the
Web browser. The Web browser is software that runs on the Web client (user
computer ) and it interprets HTML tags to display the contents of the Web page.
HTML is platform independent language. It is not a programming language like C,
C++, java and BASIC.
Basically, it is a set of markup tags that tells the browser how to display the Web
page content.
Some popular markup languages are DHTML, SGML (Standard Generalized
Markup Language), XHTML (Extended HTML),XML (Extensible Markup
Language), etc.

7 | COMPUTER SCIENCE REPORT
Tim Berners Lee developed HTML in 1990, at CERN (Conseil European pour la
Recherche Nucleaire ), the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva,
Switzerland.
There are different versions of HTML; these are HTML, HTML+, HTML 1.0,
HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01 (It has accessibility of Cascading Style sheet,
and Multimedia) and now HTML 5.0 ( It has accessibility of local storage and
offline database).

Uses of HTML

1. It is used for basic layout creating or designing the Web page.
2. Without HTML, the World Wide Web will not exist.
3. It allows embedding text, image, multimedia (audio / video) and links to
other documents and the Web pages.
4. It provides a means to create structured document by using paragraph,
character formatting, links and lists.
5. It can embed scripts such as CSS, JavaScript, which affect the behavior and
design of the Web page.
Advantages of using HTML

1. It is highly flexible and user-friendly.
2. It is an open technology that supports almost all the Web browser and
platforms like MS-Windows, Macintosh, UNIS, etc.
3. It is efficient and reliable. You can create the Web page in order to advertise
and promote products and services.
4. It is easily understandable and does not require long time training.
5. It provides search engine compatible to the Web sites.
